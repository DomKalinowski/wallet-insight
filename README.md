## Introduction
This CLI tool combines and analyses bank statements from multiple sources into a single, sortable table. Developed not to deal with MS Excel, it's a personal project aimed at understanding financial patterns over the past five years to aid in future budgeting and financial planning.

## Features
- **Combine Multiple Statements:** Merge CSV files from various banks, each potentially having different column layouts.
- **Date Sorting:** Automatically sorts entries by date to streamline analysis.
- **Selective Analysis:** Option to select and analyze statements from a single source.
- **Commander.js Integration:** Utilizes Commander.js to provide a helpful and intuitive command-line interface.
- **Visual Distinctions:** Months are colour-coded for quick identification. Even and odd years are styled differently (odd years are underlined, bolded and italic), facilitating pattern recognition over multiple years.
- **Biome.js Formatting:** Uses biome.js for enhanced formatting and alignment within the CLI output.
- **Statement Identification:** The last column in the table displays the statement's name, typically the bank's name, to quickly identify the source of the data.

{
    "dir": "/path/to/your/bank/statements/",
    "files": {
        "first-bank": "first-bank_account_statement_2000-01.12.2050.csv",
        "second-bank": "second-bank_account_statement_2000-01.12.2050.csv"
    },
